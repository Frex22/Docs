# HPC Research Symposium

This past year has been transformative for HPC research at NJIT. The introduction of our new shared HPC cluster, Wulver, has expanded our computational capacity and made research into vital areas more accessible to our faculty. The Advanced Research Computing Services group of Information Services and Technology, in collaboration with Dell Technologies, invites you to a symposium on July 16, 2024, to celebrate the launch of Wulver.

The Symposium will feature a keynote from Anthony Dina, Global Field CTO for Unstructured Data Solutions at Dell Technologies, and invited speakers from NJIT: David Bader from the Department of Data Science and Dibakar Datta from the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. The Symposium will also feature several lightning talks from NJIT researchers highlighting the use of High Performance Computing resources in their research.

Please join us to learn how our researchers use HPC resources and connect with the NJIT HPC community.
