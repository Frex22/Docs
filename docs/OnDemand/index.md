# Open OnDemand

## Overview

Open OnDemand is now available for NJIT HPC access at [ondemand.njit.edu](https://ondemand.njit.edu)!

[Open OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) is a browser-based gateway to NJIT's Wulver cluster and shared storage. It offers a graphical interface allowing users to view, edit, download, and upload files. Users can manage and create job templates for the cluster and access interactive applications such as remote desktops to cluster nodes. Additionally, Open OnDemand supports GUI-based software like Jupyter Lab/Notebook, Matlab, and RStudio, all accessible through a web browser on virtually any device. No additional software installation is necessary, and users can operate with minimal Linux and job scheduler command knowledge.


This is an [open source](https://openondemand.org/) project developed through NSF funding.
