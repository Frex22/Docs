# Wulver Outage

As part of NJIT's migration to a new Virtual Machine (VM) platform, Nutanix from (now ultra expensive) VMWare, Wulver will undergo an unplanned but required downtime to migrate critical virtual infrastructure hosting head, login, Open OnDemand and Slurm nodes starting at 8:00 AM on Friday, August 29. The cluster will be unavailable until all migration work is completed.

* Expected duration: Up to 12 hours (work may finish sooner)
* Reason: Migration to the Nutanix VM platform

## Important Information:

* Any jobs submitted before the outage that would not finish in time will be held in the queue and will resume after the cluster is back online. Please plan your usage and submissions accordingly.
* There is a minor risk that **queued jobs will be lost** during migration. We will monitor this and inform affected users, if necessary.
* Updates will be provided if there is any change to the expected downtime window.


We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding as we make this important upgrade.
