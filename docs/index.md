Welcome to HPC at NJIT.

NJIT provides High Performance Computing resources to support scientific computing for faculty and students. These resources include cpu nodes, GPU nodes, parallel storage, high speed, low latency Infiniband networking and a fully optimized scientific software stack.


!!! warning
        
    Please note that due to relocation of the Lochness cluster to the Databank colocation facility in Piscataway, the cluster will be unavailable from October 6th, 2023. We have estimated that the relocation process will require no longer than seven days to complete. During this period, the cluster will not be accessible and you will be unable to access any files housed on the cluster's filesystems as well. We understand the importance of uninterrupted access to computational resources, and we will make every effort to minimize downtime.

    Key Details:

    1. Cluster Shutdown Date: October 6th, 2023
    2. Anticipated Duration: Up to Seven Days
    3. Operational Continuity: After the move the cluster will remain operational until the end of the semester.

    Stheno will be decommissioned on  October 6th, 2023. Stheno users can access their data from Lochness when Lochness is returned to service.
