# Jobs on OnDemand

In addition to submitting jobs via batch scripts and interactive sessions, Wulver also supports [Open OnDemand](https://ondemand.njit.edu), a browser-based portal for job management.

### With OnDemand, users can:

- Submit and monitor jobs through a graphical interface
- Create and manage [job templates](../OnDemand/6_jobs.md/#jobs) without writing SLURM scripts manually
- Access [interactive applications](../OnDemand/Interactive_Apps/index.md) such as JupyterLab, Matlab, RStudio and many more directly in the browser
- Launch remote desktops on cluster nodes for GUI-based workflows
- Get access to browser based shell [terminal](../OnDemand/3_clusters.md) to access Wulver

### OnDemand is ideal for:

- New users who are unfamiliar with Linux and SLURM commands
- Researchers who prefer a graphical interface
- Anyone who wants quick access to interactive HPC applications
