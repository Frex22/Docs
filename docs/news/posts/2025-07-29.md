# Wulver Maintenance

Wulver will be out of service on Tuesday, September 9th, for OS and SLURM updates.

## Maintenance Plans
* Upgrade the OS: Upgrade from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9: This will resolve the glibc error users encounter when compiling the latest packages. For details, see [FAQ](rhel_9_faq.md).
* Upgrade SLURM version.
* Implement new SU calculation: This will allow users to consume fewer SUs when using a single GPU instead of all 4 GPUs on a node.
* Implement [MIG](../../MIG/index.md).
* Add Lochness nodes for course-related usage.
