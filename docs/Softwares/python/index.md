To load Python on Wulver user needs to use
```
module load foss/2021b Python/3.9.6
```

## Python libraries
Apart from Pythonâ€™s standard library, Python offers a wide range of additional libraries which need to loaded as modules before user can use these. here, we list these additional libraries. Please contact use to file a ticket with [Service Now](mailto:hpc@njit.edu) in case you do not find the libraries you want to use.

|  Libraries   |  Version  |  Python Version  |           Module load command           |
|:------------:|:---------:|:----------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|    NumPy     |  1.21.3   |      3.9.6       |  `module load foss/2021b SciPy-bundle`  |
|  Matplotlib  |   3.4.3   |      3.9.6       |   `module load foss/2021b matplotlib`   |
|    SciPy     |  2021.10  |      3.9.6       |  `module load foss/2021b SciPy-bundle`  |

For using multiple libraries, you simply need to add the library name in `module load` command. For example, to load NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy together you need to use the following command. 

```
module load foss/2021b SciPy-bundle matplotlib
```
