!!! warning
        
    Please note that due to relocation of the Lochness cluster to the Databank colocation facility in Piscataway, the cluster will be unavailable from October 6th, 2023. We anticipated that the relocation process will require no longer than seven days to complete, however Lochness will be out of service for longer than expected, at least until end-of-day Wed **Oct 18th**.  The reinstallation is complete, but repairs and testing are taking longer than anticipated.

    Key Details:

    1. Cluster Shutdown Date: October 6th, 2023
    2. Anticipated Availibility : Oct 18th, 2023
    3. Operational Continuity: After the move the cluster will remain operational until the end of the semester.

    Stheno was decommissioned on October 6th, 2023. Stheno users can access their data from Lochness when Lochness is returned to service.
