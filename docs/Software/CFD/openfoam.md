title: OpenFOAM
---
OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) is a free and open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package that is used to simulate and analyze fluid flow, heat transfer, and other related phenomena. It is written primarily in C++ and can be used on various operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and macOS.

OpenFOAM offers a wide range of solvers, turbulence models, and physical models that can be used to model various engineering applications such as automotive, aerospace, chemical processing, and power generation. It also allows users to customize and extend its functionality to meet specific needs.

The software is widely used in academia, research, and industry, and is known for its robustness, flexibility, and scalability. It offers a high degree of parallelization, which allows it to be used on large clusters of computers for complex simulations. Because it is open source, it is often used by researchers and developers to create new solvers, models, and add-ons for specific applications.
