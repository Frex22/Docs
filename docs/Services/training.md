# HPC Education and Training

NJIt HPC provides practical training in high-performance computing for students and researchers at various levels of expertise. HPC training for research professionals aims to enhance their capabilities in utilizing high-performance computing, data-intensive computing, and data analytics within their respective research fields. 

## Training Programs

By incorporating HPC resources into your course, you provide students with the opportunity to engage in hands-on, real-world applications of computational concepts. The HPC environment enhances the learning experience and prepares students for challenges in data-driven and computationally intensive fields. For specific requests or to schedule an HPC introduction session, please contact the [HPC Facilitator](contact.md).
