# MIG GPU Testing on Wulver Now Available

We’re excited to announce that MIG-enabled GPUs are now available on Wulver for workflow testing!

We currently have 4 GPUs configured with MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) profiles as follows:

* 40 GB profile – 1 MIG instance per GPU
* 20 GB profile – 1 MIG instance per GPU
* 10 GB profile – 2 MIG instances per GPU

This effectively allows the 4 GPUs to perform as 16 GPUs of varying RAM sizes. These MIG instances allow you to run multiple workloads in parallel with dedicated GPU resources, improving efficiency for smaller jobs and testing scenarios.

???+ question "Who can use them?"

    All Wulver users are welcome to test their workflows on these new MIG profiles. Using the `debug_gpu` partition no Service Units (SUs) will be charged for these jobs. Modify your batch scripts to include these directives:

    ```slurm
    #SBATCH --partition=debug_gpu
    #SBATCH --qos=debug
    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100_10g:1      # Change to 20g or 40g as needed
    #SBATCH --time=59:00 # Debug_gpu partition has a 12 hour walltime limit
    ```


???+ question "What should you do?"

    * Read through the MIG documentation on the HPC website.
    * Test your GPU-enabled workflows with these MIG resources.
    * Verify that your job scripts and containers handle MIG devices correctly.
    * Share feedback on performance and any issues you encounter.

This is a testing phase, so configurations may change based on usage and feedback. For more details, check the [MIG documentation](../../MIG/index.md).
