# Wulver Maintenance

Wulver will be out of service on Tuesday, August 12th, for OS and SLURM updates.

## Maintenance Plans
* Upgrade the OS: Upgrade from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9: This will resolve the glibc error users encounter when compiling the latest packages.
* Upgrade SLURM version.
* Implement new SU calculation: This will allow users to consume fewer SUs when using a single GPU instead of all 4 GPUs on a node.
* Implement [MIG](slurm.md#multi-instance-gpu-mig).
* Add Lochness nodes for course-related usage.
