# Facilities Statement

Facilities statement for inculsion in grant proposals:

As New Jersey’s Science and Technology University, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) has developed a local cyberinfrastructure well positioned to allow NJIT faculty and students to collaborate at local, national, and global levels on many issues at the forefront of science and engineering research.

## Cyberinfrastructure

NJIT’s Information Services and Technology (IST) resources provide members of the university community with universal access to a wealth of resources and services available over the NJIT network. NJIT's multi-100 gigabit backbone and multi-gigabit user network provides access to classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, faculty and staff offices, the library, student organization offices and others.  50% of these locations are provided with speeds of 5Gb/s or more.  The campus wireless network 2,900+ access points blanket the university’s public areas, classrooms, offices, collaboration spaces and outdoor areas.  Over 60% of the Wi-Fi network is Wi-fi 6 capable, enabling NJIT’s mobile users connectivity with multiple devices at increasing speeds. NJIT’s connectivity to NJEdge, NJ’s state-wide higher education network, provides access to the Internet and Internet 2.  Students have the opportunity to work closely with faculty and researchers as new families of advanced applications are developed for an increasingly networked and information-based society.  NJIT is also directly connected to cloud service providers such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) to provide low latency high speed access to cloud resources. A redundant diverse 100Gb network connection is being provisioned to support NJIT’s new HPC co-location facility in Piscataway NJ.

## Compute Resources

NJIT’s Advanced Research Computing Services (ARCS) group presently maintains two HPC clusters, a 224 node heterogenous condominium cluster Lochness, and a 32 node cluster for the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Stheno. In addition, multiple IST teams are working on deploying Wulver, a 127 node heterogeneous condominium cluster at the new HPC co-location facility, Databank in Piscataway NJ, expectedto be available for general use by Q1 2023.
